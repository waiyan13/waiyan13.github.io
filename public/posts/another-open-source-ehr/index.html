In the world of startups, healthcare startups are considered to be &ldquo;tarpits&rdquo;
due to regulation hurdles and huge Customer Acquistion Cost (CAC). Moreover,
there are numerous open-source alternatives in active development (e.g.
OpenEMR and OpenMRS).
This begs the question why I am developing a new EHR product instead of
contributing to the existing ones. There are a couple of reasons for that:

Because I want to. I would like to see for myself how complex it can get.
This may be an exercise in futility but you will only know when you try.
The more alternatives, the better. The beauty of open-source is that you can
stand on the shoulders of your predecessors to further the capabilities of
the software in a domain.

That said, there are a few things I would like to achieve in this project." />

<p>In the world of startups, healthcare startups are considered to be &ldquo;tarpits&rdquo;
due to regulation hurdles and huge Customer Acquistion Cost (CAC). Moreover,
there are numerous open-source alternatives in active development (e.g.
<a href="https://www.open-emr.org/">OpenEMR</a> and <a href="https://openmrs.org/">OpenMRS</a>).</p>
<p>This begs the question why I am developing a new EHR product instead of
contributing to the existing ones. There are a couple of reasons for that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Because I want to. I would like to see for myself how complex it can get.
This may be an exercise in futility but you will only know when you try.</li>
<li>The more alternatives, the better. The beauty of open-source is that you can
stand on the shoulders of your predecessors to further the capabilities of
the software in a domain.</li>
</ol>
<p>That said, there are a few things I would like to achieve in this project.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir">FHIR</a> compliant. I want this project to be
interoperable with existing systems by making data exchange possible.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-ehrs/certification-health-it">ONC</a>
compliant. There are other desirable certification such as <a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2">SOC 2 Type
II</a>
but ONC certification will be the current focus.</li>
<li>Excellent UX. The system should get out of the way of the practitioners in
getting the answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>My past work experiences in implementing patient appointment systems for two
healthcare institutions of different size gave me some insights into healthcare
industry in third world and developing countries. The purpose of this project
is to give viable alternatives to the commercial solutions for the large and
medium hospital in these countries.</p>
<p>The next step is to decide scope of features and data modelling based on FHIR
R5.</p>
