## Motivation

In the world of startups, healthcare startups are considered to be "tarpits"
due to regulation hurdles and huge Customer Acquistion Cost (CAC). Moreover,
there are numerous open-source alternatives in active development (e.g.
[OpenEMR](https://www.open-emr.org/) and [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/)).

This begs the question why I am developing a new EHR product instead of
contributing to the existing ones. There are a couple of reasons for that:

1. Because I want to. I would like to see for myself how complex it can get.
   This may be an exercise in futility but you will only know when you try.
2. The more alternatives, the better. The beauty of open-source is that you can
   stand on the shoulders of your predecessors to further the capabilities of
   the software in a domain.

That said, there are a few things I would like to achieve in this project.

## Goals

1. [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir) compliant. I want this project to be
   interoperable with existing systems by making data exchange possible.
2. Excellent UX. The system should get out of the way of the practitioners in
   getting the answers.

My past work experiences in implementing patient appointment systems for two
healthcare institutions of different size gave me some insights into healthcare
industry in third world and developing countries. The purpose of this project
is to give viable alternatives to the commercial solutions for the large and
medium hospital in these countries.

The next step is to decide scope of features and data modelling based on FHIR
R5.
